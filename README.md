Challenges faced:

The original design was in PHP, but GitHub Pages donâ€™t support PHP directly, so I had to consider converting the project to client-side JavaScript fetch.

Matching the spacing and typography exactly from the screenshot required some CSS adjustments.

Ensuring responsiveness for both desktop and mobile was a bit tricky, but Bootstrap grid made it easier.
