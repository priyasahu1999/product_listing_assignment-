Challenges faced:

The original design was in PHP, but I used both PHP and JavaScript for fetching data with different files.
Matching the spacing and typography exactly from the screenshot required some CSS adjustments.
Ensuring responsiveness for both desktop and mobile was a bit tricky, but Bootstrap grid made it easier.
